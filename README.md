What you need to Run:
You must have Gradle 6.3+ and Java 18+ installed. 

Check you Gradle and Java versions by:
gradle --version

and

java -version

if you do not want to download gradle manually, you can also use the gradle wrapper. Here is a command you can use in terminal:

gradle wrapper --gradle-version 8.1.1



Once you have gradle and java properly installed, you can just run the program normally through intellij or through the terminal
